ðŸš€ **New Project: Tweety - A Simple Task Feed App** ðŸš€

Iâ€™ve just deployed a brand-new project called **Tweety**! Itâ€™s a simple web app that simulates a task feed where you can:

- **Post tasks**
- **Like and Retweet**
- **Reply to tasks**
- **Delete tasks**

All the data is saved in **localStorage**, so no worries about losing your tasks even after a page refresh. 

Check it out and feel free to contribute! ðŸŽ‰

You can find the repo here: [Tweety on GitHub](https://github.com/Kaleab-Shewangizaw/Tweety)
